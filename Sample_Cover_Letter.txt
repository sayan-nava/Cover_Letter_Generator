Dear Hiring Manager,

My name is Sayan Kumar Das, and I am writing this letter to express my interest in the Software Developer opening at XYZ. I believe that I can offer a significant contribution to your team. My passion for designing back-end has only grown during my career, and I am excited about the opportunity to showcase my skills.

Since my first job at ABC Company, I've consistently grown as a developer. Not only am I dedicated to completing my work promptly and thoroughly, I am also committed to actively learning from every experience I have. At my first workplace, I learnt about what it takes to succeed in this field, and I've carried that lesson throughout the years as I've worked.

Although I began as an XYZ Role at ABC Company, I eventually earned a position as a XYZ Role at DEF Company. While working at the client site, I regularly exceeded client expectations and delivered a web application, built from scratch. Working in this current role taught me many important lessons, but it also helped me realize my true passion for developing software. I am excited about the opportunity to bring this passion, experience and talent to XYZ.

Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I'm looking forward to talking to you and learning more about this position. I know I have a lot to offer this company, and I'd love to show you what I can bring to the team.


Sincerely,
Sayan Kumar Das
